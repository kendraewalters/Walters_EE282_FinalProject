Names of bash scripts are preceded by a number that indicates the order of execution. Start with 01 and end with 14. There is no 08. I accidentally skipped that one. 

Answers to the questions are below (with the exception of plots) but should also be displayed in the terminal window. 

Thank you for a great quarter! I learned a lot in this class and appreciate the effort you put into it.
